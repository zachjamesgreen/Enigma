# Self Eval

This project was a fun one. I love that this is the real first time I had to use modulo in a project.
This project had me expand my thinking about how to solve problems I may have seen before but in a different way.
This project also made me realize that I still really do love coding. The problem solving and building an application
from the ground up.

Functionality: 3.5
- i found that the cracking of the text was easy but getting the key back was a more difficult task

Object Oriented Programming: 3.0
- I only used one class. I felt that for the scope of the project that one class would be enough.

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: 2.7
- I found that some methods could be completed mor efficiently by chaining methods.

Test Driven Development: 2.9
